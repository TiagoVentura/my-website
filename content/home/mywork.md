My primary research interests are comparative political economy with focus on welfare institutions, redistributions and income inequality.  For my dissertation project, I focus on the relationship between violence and welfare politics.  In addition to my dissertation project, I am currently working applying spatial voting models to analyze twitter data with  [Ernesto Calvo](http://gvptsites.umd.edu/calvo/), the chair of my PhD Committe. Additionally, With [Mariana Carvalho](http://www.maricarvalho.com/)  I have a working paper on political cycles of violence in Brazil, where using a unique dataset on political assassination in the country we research the conditions that triggers the use of violence on the electoral cycles in the country.


Most of my previous research have focused on participatory innovations in Latin American. I published a co-authored [article](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/dados/v60n1/0011-5258-dados-60-1-0007.pdf) with [Thamy Pogrebinschi](https://thamypogrebinschi.org/) about the impact of the National Conferences of Public Policy in the quality of democracy in Brazil. Working on this agenda, I received a DAAD Fellowship to be a visiting research assistant at WZB, Berlin.  

I have had the opportunity to work on a numerous of projects about Brazilian Politics. with [Talita Tanscheit](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4451567H6), [Fabiano Santos](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4782116Z3), I am currently working a paper about the impact of the internal facctions of the Workers' Party on the policy choices of the Party; Furthermore,  [Natalia Maciel](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4219233E9) and I published a [article](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/op/v23n1/1807-0191-op-23-1-0096.pdf) about changes in the electoral basis of the Workers Party in the legislative election.
