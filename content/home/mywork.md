In my doctoral dissertation, I seek to understand how violence changes the electoral market in developing democracies with particular focus in Latin America. I extend economic models of individual preferences for welfare and social policy provision - endogenously determined by income inequality - to understand changes in the political arena brought by rising violence. My dissertation asks how violence changes citizens' demands for state protection, how violence changes the supply of politicians campaigning on more punitive solutions for crime, and how wealth inequality determines the unequal provision of security by the criminal justice agencies

Outside of my dissertation, my methodological work focuses on a variety of projects related to
computational social science. In a co-authored work with [Dr. Ernesto Calvo](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cas/faculty_and_staff/faculty_affairs/_profiles/sawyer.php) - the chair of my PhD Committee - and [Dr. Natalia Aruguete](https://unq.academia.edu/nataliaaruguete), we consider a model in which readers vote on social media by embedding links to news organizations on Twitter and journalists modify news content to maximize readership. This follows an extensive literature on spatial models of voting, the model estimates the importance of ideological congruence, reputation, and issue attention through the embedding of media links to news organizations in social media. Still in the network models, in a second work with [Dr. Ernesto Calvo](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cas/faculty_and_staff/faculty_affairs/_profiles/sawyer.php) and [Dr. Joan Timoneda](https://joantimoneda.netlify.com/), we propose a application of the Geographically Weighted Regression Model to twitter data in order to deal with spatial dependency and heterogeneous network effects in a computationally efficient way. Finally, 
I have also been involved in collaborative research with [Dr. William Reed](http://willreed.org/) and [Dr.Katherine Sawyer](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/cas/faculty_and_staff/faculty_affairs/_profiles/sawyer.php). In this project, we use computational text analysis to analyze the content of constitutions created by rebel groups involved in civil wars.

Additionally,  I have been involved in a variety of projects more focused on Brazilian politics. I have been working in a single-authored paper in which I combine RDD and Lasso models to deal with partisan reverse coattail effects in mayoral politics in Brazil. With [Mariana Carvalho](http://www.maricarvalho.com/), I have  a working paper investigating political cycles of violence against politicians in Brazil. I published a co-authored [article](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/dados/v60n1/0011-5258-dados-60-1-0007.pdf) with [Thamy Pogrebinschi](https://thamypogrebinschi.org/) about the impact of the National Conferences of Public Policy in the quality of democracy in Brazil. With [Talita Tanscheit](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4451567H6), and [Fabiano Santos](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4782116Z3), I am currently working in a forthcoming paper about the impact of the internal factions of the Workers' Party (PT) on its policy choices in particular in the adoption of participatory innovation in the local level. Furthermore,  [Natalia Maciel](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4219233E9) and I published an [article](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/op/v23n1/1807-0191-op-23-1-0096.pdf) about changes in the electoral basis of the Workers Party considering the national legislative elections in Brazil. 

Finally, I have been fortunate with the opportunity to attend some of the Summer Institutes focused in political methodological during the last two years. In 2018, I attended the ICPSR Summer Institute receiving the generous funding from the EITM Certification Scholarship. This summer, I will be attending the Summer Institute in Computational Social Science in Princeton and the Summer Institute of the EITM in Emory.
