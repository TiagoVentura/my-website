My broader research interests focus on the political consequences of wealth inequality. For my dissertation project, I am currently on the relationship between violence, crime, policing and  politics of inequality in Brazil. Additionally, with [Mariana Carvalho](http://www.maricarvalho.com/)  I have been working on a paper investigating political cycles of violence in Brazil.  Using a unique dataset on political assassinations, we research the conditions that trigger the use of violence on the Brazilian electoral cycles. 

Furthermore, I am currently working on a project applying spatial voting models to analyze Twitter data with  [Ernesto Calvo](http://gvptsites.umd.edu/calvo/) the chair of my Ph.D. Committee, and Natalia Aruguete. We present the first version of the paper on August 2018 at APSA

I have had the opportunity to work on a numerous of projects about Brazilian Politics. I published a co-authored [article](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/dados/v60n1/0011-5258-dados-60-1-0007.pdf) with [Thamy Pogrebinschi](https://thamypogrebinschi.org/) about the impact of the National Conferences of Public Policy in the quality of democracy in Brazil. With [Talita Tanscheit](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4451567H6), and [Fabiano Santos](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4782116Z3), I am currently working a paper under review about the impact of the internal factions of the Workers' Party (PT) on its policy choices in particular in the adoption of participatory innovation in the local level. Furthermore,  [Natalia Maciel](http://buscatextual.cnpq.br/buscatextual/visualizacv.do?id=K4219233E9) and I published an [article](http://www.scielo.br/pdf/op/v23n1/1807-0191-op-23-1-0096.pdf) about changes in the electoral basis of the Workers Party in the legislative election.
