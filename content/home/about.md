# About Me


Hi, welcome to my website!

I am a second year Ph.D. Student in Political Science at the University of Maryland, College Park. I hold a Master degree in Political Science from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, and a BA in Law at Federal University of Para, Brazil. My research agenda is broadly speaking focused on politics of wealth inequality and its consequences for politics with a regional focus in Latin America.
