# About Me

Hi, I am a second year Ph.D. Student in Political Science at University of Maryland, College Park. I hold a Master degree in Political Science from the State University of Rio de Janeiro, and a JD in Law at Federal University of Para, Brazil. My research agenda is located at the intersection of political institutions and political behavior, with a regional focus in Latin America. I also research on political methodology with particular focus on computational methods, causal inference and spatial voting models.
